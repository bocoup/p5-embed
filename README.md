# p5-embed

A prototype for a faster, more accessible p5.js code embed and preview component. This prototype has basic functionality and no styling outside of that needed for the code editor area itself.

## Trying it out

To view the demo page:

Ensure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your machine.

```shellsession
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm serve
```

Open `http://[::]:8000/test-site/` in a browser.

Note that the `serve` script requires python. Alternative local server options also work.

## Source code

The component code is at [src/component.tsx](./src/component.tsx).
